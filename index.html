        <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <li>Web</li>
          <li>Web browser</li>
          <li>Web server</li>

          <strong>Web</strong> - Short for world wide web (www). It is a hypertext-based global
          information system and a subset of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Web Browser</strong> - A software application that allows users to access and
          navigate web pages on the internet.
        </p>
        <div>
          <div><span><strong>Web Server</strong></span></div> - refers to both software and hardware working together.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hardware</strong> - A computer that stores web server software and a website's component files. It connects to the internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.</li>
                <li><strong>Software</strong> - Controls how web users access hosted files via a HTTP server. A HTTP server is software which understands URL's and HTTP (the protocol the browser uses to view webpages). HTTP servers are accessed through the domain names of the website it stores, it then delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Basically, when a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the request reaches the correct web server (hardware) the HTTP (software) server accepts the request, locates the requested document and sends it back to the browser, also through the HTTP. If the server doesnt find the document it returns a 404 response.

            <strong>HTML</strong> - (Hyper Text Markup Language). It is a standard markup language for web page creation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>CSS</strong> - (Cascading Style Sheets). This is a language used to style HTML elements.

        <p>
            <strong>Javascript</strong> - A programming language that developers use to create interactive websites and web applications.

        <h3>How The Internet Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Protocols</li>
            <li>IP Addresses</li>
            <li>Client</li>
            <li>Doman Name System (DNS)</li>
            <li>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</li>

            <li>Port</li>
            <li>Localhost</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Protocols</strong> - A protocol is a set of rules for routing and addressing packets of data. In relation to the internet, it would be called an Internet Protocol (IP).
        </p>
        <p>
            <span1><strong>IP addresses</strong></span1> - A unique identifier assigned to a device or domain that connects to the internet.
        <div class="ipAddress"><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4tzfU9Y5ows0uT3u4GUlWr/9d4eaa83ce372454cc14d5fec83fb5b1/internet_protocol_ip_address_diagram.svg"></div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Client</strong> - A remote device capable of using the internet to access selected licensed software (the requesting program). e.g. any computer or software device with access to the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span2><strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong></span2> - The phonebook of the internet. We access information online via domain names e.g. google.com. Web browsers interact through the IP addresses, DNS translates the domain to IP addresses so browsers can load internet resources.
        </p>

            <strong>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong> - Used to load webpages using hypertext links. It is designed to transfer information between networked devices. A typical flow over HTTP involves a clinet machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Mobile Apps</strong> - You know what these are!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Port</strong> - A virtual point where network connections start and end. Each port is associated with a specific process or service. Ports allow computers to easily differenciate between different kinds of traffic: emails go to a different port than webpages, for instance, even though both reach a computer over the same Internet connection.
            <p>
                Ports are standardized across all network-connected devices, with each port assigned a number. Most ports are reserved for certain protocols — for example, all Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages go to port 80. While IP addresses enable messages to go to and from specific devices, port numbers allow targeting of specific services or applications within those devices.
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Localhost</strong> - In computer networking, host means a “server”. Just like you can put a website on the internet by hosting it on a server, you can make your own computer that server. This connection is called loopback. The IP address for that loopback is 127.0.0.1.
            <p>
            So, by definition, localhost is the computer or hostname currently making a request to itself. In this case, the computer is also the virtual server.
